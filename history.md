As soon as Michelangelo Alasa heard that the theater on the second floor of 62 East 4th Street was up for rent, he grabbed a crowbar and moved toward the stairs. He swung open wooden doors on his way; his feet hit cracked, uneven white tile that on other occasions he’d stopped to admire. He made it to the stairs and began a slow, certain descent to the next floor. The marble stairway walls had been painted over since before his time, a murky indefinite color offensive mainly due to what it covered. It was 1996, and the time had come to liberate the remnants of the storied century-old theater and reclaim its striking heritage.



At the bottom of the stairs Alasa stopped. He stood before a door he had walked past every day on the way to his office upstairs, and usually ignored: it was tall, wooden and thick, perched on the edge of the stairwell, just a flight above the lobby. There were two wide holes where the doorknobs should have been, a heavy chain draped through them and padlocked by the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Alasa set his crowbar against the lock. It broke off on the first try. The weight of the chain pulled the lock down to the marble landing. He pulled open the door and stepped into the dark.

The door swung back on him, slammed him from behind and knocked him to the ground. The flashlight flew out of his hand. Alasa scrambled to his feet, found the flashlight, and moved it around. It was like entering an ancient tomb. Cherubs, goddesses and weightless billowed clouds loomed out from vast faded murals; three enormous regal chandelier canopies dripped down from the ceiling into futile, empty hooks; a gilded proscenium arch yawned over an abandoned stage. As Alasa moved around the room, he stumbled over chairs, boxes and lamps. Like the rest of the theater, the stage was full of trash. It was gritty, musty, and disused.

But this was where it had happened. The significance overwhelmed him. Hadn’t Emma Goldman stood in this room, days before she was deported to Finland in 1919? Andy Warhol in 1969 [rented out](https://warholstars.org/andy_warhol_fortune_theatre.html) this theater to show silent gay porn; Alasa remembered feeling as if he had stepped into a circus, Warhol standing as the ringleader, right there. Lingering in this room were the specters of army posts, meeting to remind themselves of the time they spent shoulder-to-shoulder and reliant on one another for their own lives.

Now this place was littered with old theatrical sets, costumes and upholstered chairs affixed to rotting floors. In the back there sat a grimy couch. Alasa couldn’t see clearly with his flashlight, and the light switches were useless. He ran back upstairs and strung together a set of extension cords from his office, running them down the painted-over marble stairs and through the tall doors to hook up as many lights as he could find.

The effect was incredible: Now you could see it! Francis Coppola shooting The Godfather II, Chevy Chase running around the theater with Laraine Newman, Divine practicing for Women Behind Bars, minor Manhattan socialites toasting at their wedding receptions, the formation and meetings of the Musical Mutual Protective Union, J. I. Rodale running play after play after play off-Broadway.

At the time, Alasa was the artistic director for the Duo Multicultural Arts Center, producing shows on the third floor in the only legally used space in the building, which Duo shared with the Rod Rodgers Dance Company. From his office above the theater, Alasa had heard squatters coming in and out, presumably breaking in through the windows, holding raucous raves and raising plywood bunks to make a warren of lofted love nests.

Alasa was hungry for a larger canvas. Expanding downstairs was the logical next move but the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which had claim on the space, was seeking a major theater venture to rent it, not a modest outfit like Duo. Alasa knew that if he didn’t make an audacious move, he wouldn’t stand a chance of securing the space.

The room that eventually became a theater was built in 1889, when a German immigrant named Victor Eckstein bought the lot next door to his house at 64 East 4th Street. He had been renting out his own house for meetings, which he found a lucrative enough endeavor to want to expand. Like Alasa a century later, Eckstein wanted more room. He hired Max Schroff to design a new building on the property, and on May 29, 1889, work began on 62 East 4th Street. Eckstein spent $35,000 on construction. Schroff used hand-burned brick, blue stone-covered walls, spruce floor beams and yellow pine girders. The floor and ceiling were arched with brick, and the roof laid flat with tin. It took a day under seven months to finish, and in less than a fortnight, the five-story meetinghouse was up and running.

Eckstein called it the Metropolitan Assembly Rooms, and layered each floor according to its purpose. The basement was a restaurant, which served a dining room on the first floor. The second and third stories were meeting rooms. Eckstein, whose youngest daughter Bertha was born in the same year his building went up, moved into the top two floors with his family of seven. Almost everyone called it Eckstein’s Metropolitan Assembly Rooms, and it quickly became a favorite rallying point for labor unions, volunteer organizations, anarchists, musicians and Army posts.

One group of former Union soldiers made the Metropolitan Assembly Rooms its headquarters, and met regularly under the name of John Lafayette Riker, their colonel who fell at the Battle of Fair Oaks in Virginia. Riker, a firefighter and lawyer, had an accidental – if successful – military career. The only stain on his record was a court-martial for having a woman, dressed as a male soldier, in his regiment. Although Riker died in 1882, the last surviving members of his post met at Eckstein’s Metropolitan Assembly Rooms to remember their time in the Civil War together. At their gatherings they elected officers for their club, socialized with their wives, and on a hot day in August in 1898, presented two deeply moved veterans with gold badges.
